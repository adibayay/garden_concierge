1,Tomatoes,Fruit,Begginer,"Tomatoes are America’s favorite garden vegetable. (Yes, we technically eat the fruit of the tomato plant, but it's used as a vegetable in eating and cooking and, thus, usually categorized in vegetables.) This vine plant is fairly easy to grow and will produce a bumper crop with proper care. Its uses are versatile, however, tomatoes are susceptible to a range of pests and diseases.",Full Sun,Make sure soil remains moist but is well-drained.,"Final plant spacing should be 12 to 24 inches apart in all directions for determinate varitieties, 24-36"" apart for indeterminate, unstaked varieties, and 14-20"" for staking.","Tomatoes can be either determinate(bush) or indeterminate(climbing) varieties. Determinate varieties can be grown without support, and they typically yield all of their fruit in the span of a few weeks. Indeterminate varieties should be staked, trellised, or caged, and pruned for optimal yields. They yield their fruit over a more extended time period. Tomatoes make great neighbors for basil plants in the garden.",9w-7RoH_uic,https://www.johnnyseeds.com/dw/image/v2/BBBW_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-jss-master/default/dw740e541d/images/products/vegetables/02063_01_bigbeef.jpg?sw=387&cx=146&cy=0&cw=1196&ch=1196,"Leave your tomatoes on the vine as long as possible. The perfect tomato for picking will be firm and very red in color, regardless of size, with perhaps some yellow remaining around the stem. A ripe tomato will be only slightly soft. Pick at the base of the stem.
",Water seedlings with a high-phosphate fertilizer solution for best results.,Indeterminate varieties will need trellised or caged for best growing results.,"Learn the common tomato diseases in your area and try to select the most resistant varieties. For prevention, use young, healthy transplants, avoid overhead irrigation, rotate crops, and do not handle tobacco or smoke before handling plants. Fungicides can reduce certain diseases when properly selected and applied. Prevent blossom end rot by providing abundant soil calcium and an even supply of soil moisture.",Use row covers to protect young seedlings from flea beetles. Tomato hornworms can be controlled with bacillus thuringiensis.,,,,,
2,Cabbage,Leafy green,Experienced,"Cabbage is a hardy, leafy vegetable full of vitamins. It can be difficult to grow; it only likes cool temperatures, and it can be a magnet for some type of pests.

This will take around 70 days for most green cabbage varieties. Most early varieties will produce 1- to 3-pound heads.  Cut each cabbage head at its base with a sharp knife. After harvesting, bring inside or put in shade immediately. To get two crops from early cabbage plants, cut the cabbage head out of the plant, leaving the outer leaves and root in the garden. The plant will send up new heads—pinch them off until only four or so smaller heads remain. When these grow to tennis-ball size, they’ll be perfect for salad.","Fertilize 2 weeks after transplanting with a balanced (10-10-10) fertilizer. Three weeks later, add a nitrogen-rich fertilizer; cabbage needs nitrogen in the early stages.",Practice crop rotation with cabbages to avoid a buildup of soil-borne diseases.,Splitting,"Cabbageworms, Aphid, Flea Beetles",,,,,
3,Cauliflower,Vegetable,Master,"Cauliflower is a cool-season crop and a descendant of the common cabbage. It is more difficult to than its relatives because it does not tolerate the heat or cold as well. For this reason, cauliflower is usually grown commercially. If you plan to attempt growing cauliflower in the home garden, it requires consistently cool temperatures with temperatures in the 60s. Otherwise, it prematurely “button”—form small button-size heads—rather than forming one, nice white head.",Full Sun,"Cauliflower requires consistent soil moisture. They need 1 to 1.5 inches of water each week; with normal rainfall, this usually requires supplement watering.",Space the transplants 18 to 24 inches apart with 30 inches between rows.,Soil needs be very rich in organic matter; add compost to the soil before planting.

Ideally, the heads will grow 6 to 8 inches in diameter. Cut the heads off the plant with a large knife. Be sure to leave some of the leaves around the head to keep it protected. If the heads are too small but have started to open up, they will not improve and should be harvested. If the cauliflower has a coarse appearance, it is too mature and should be tossed.",,"Note that the cauliflower will start out as a loose head and it takes time for the head to form. Many varieties take at least 75 to 85 days from transplant. Be patient. When the curd (the white head) is about 2 to 3 inches in diameter, tie the outer leaves together over the head with a rubber band, tape, or twine. This is called blanching, and it protects the head from the sun and helps you get that pretty white color. The plants are usually ready for harvest 7 to 12 days after blanching.","Clubroot, Black Rot","Cabbageworm, Aphids, Harlequin Bugs",,,,,
4,Celery,Vegetable,Master,"Celery is a long-season crop that can be tricky to grow, some might say, the trickiest of all. It likes fertile soil, cool temperatures, and constant moisture. It will not tolerate heat and can be hard to transplant. Summer crops in the north and winter crops in the south make celery a year-round producer. All the work is worth it when you harvest crunchy, green stalks.",Partial Sun,"Celery is a heavy feeder. It also requires lots of water. Make sure to provide plenty of water during the entire growing season, especially during hot, dry weather. If celery does not get enough water, the stalks will be dry, and small. Fertilize regularly.

5,Chives,Herb,Begginer,"Chives are a perennial member of the onion family that sport beautiful purple flowers. Chives are cool-season, cold-tolerant perennials that are planted in early spring. Be mindful when planting this herb, as it will take over your garden if the flowers are left to ripen (the flowers scatter the seeds). However, this plant is easy to dig up and move if it overwhelms your garden.",Full Sun,"It is important to give chives consistent watering throughout the growing season for high yields. Moisten the soil thoroughly when watering. Use mulch to conserve moisture and keep the weeds down. Minimal care is needed for fully grown plants. After the flowers bloom, be sure to remove them so that the seeds aren't spread throughout your garden. Remember to divide the plants every 3 to 4 years in the spring. Chives are much more productive if divided regularly. Allow divided plants to grow for several weeks before harvesting.",Final plant spacing should be 4 to 6 inches apart in all directions.,"Soil needs to be moist, fertile, rich, and well-draining. Before planting, incorporate 4 to 6 inches of well-composted organic matter. Apply 2 to 3 tablespoons of all-purpose fertilizer (16-16-8) per square foot of planting area.

Pick about one fistful of leaves per harvest. Avoid picking the terminal bud (found at the top center of the plant) because this will help to keep the plant productive. The small, tender leaves can be eaten uncooked and used in salads.","Collards are fast growers and producers, so it’s essential to feed them regularly with a water-soluble plant food.",,,"Cabbageworms, Flea beetles, Aphids",,,,,
7,Cucumber,Vegetable,Begginer,"Cucumbers are a warm-season vegetable planted outside in the ground no earlier than 2 weeks after last spring frost date. Most varieties will grow in any amount of space, thanks to the plant's ability to climb. The most common varieties of slicing cucumbers have sprawling vines with large green leaves and curling tendrils. The growth of these plants is fast, and the crop yield is abundant if you care for them properly.",Full Sun,"When seedlings emerge, begin to water frequently, and increase to a gallon per week after fruit forms. Water consistently; put your finger in the soil and when it is dry past the first joint of your finger, it is time to water. Inconsistent watering leads to bitter-tasting fruit. Water slowly in the morning or early afternoon, avoding the leaves.","When seedlings reach 4 inches tall, thin plants so that  they are 1½ feet apart.","A trellis might be a good idea if you want the vine to climb, or if you have limited space.

Harvest dills at 4 to 6 inches long and pickles at 2 inches long for pickles. Harvest by cutting or pinching at the base of the fruit. Cucumbers are best picked before they seeds become hard and are eaten when immature. Do not let them get yellow. A cucumber is of highest quality when it is uniformly green, firm and crisp. At peak harvesting time, you should be picking cucumbers every couple of days. Keep them picked. If you don’t, as plants mature, they will stop producing.","If you've worked in organic matter into the soil before planting, you may only need to side-dress your plants with compost. Or, if you wish, use a fertilizer from your garden store which is low nitrogen/high potassium and phosphorus formula and apply at planting, 1 week after bloom, and every 3 weeks with liquid food, applying directly to the soil around the plants. Or, you can work a granular fertilizer into the soil. Do not overfertilize or the fruits will get stunted.","Mulch to hold in soil moisture.

Spray vines with sugar water to attract bees and set more fruit.","Bacterial Wilt, Mosaic Viruses","Cucumber Beetles, Whiteflies",,,,,
8,Corn,Vegetable,Experienced,"Sweet corn is an annual with yellow, white, and bi-colored ears. A long, frost-free growing season is necessary after planting. Sweet corn is wind-pollinated, so it should be planted in blocks, rather than in single rows. Early, mid, and late-season varieties extend the harvest. If you miss the optimal harvest time, corn will go downhill fast as sugars convert to starch.",Full Sun,"Water well at planting time. Soil must be well drained and able to keep consistent moisture. In dry conditions, be sure to keep corn well watered due to its shallow roots. Water at a rate of 5 gallons per sq yard. Mulch helps reduce evaporation.","When your plants are 3 to 4 inches tall, thin them so they are 8 to 12 inches apart.",Corn is picky about its soil.

19,Pumpkins,Vegetable,Experienced,"Whether you use them for carving or cooking, pumpkins do not disappoint. Note that pumpkins do require a lot of food and a long growing season (generally from 75 to 100 frost-free days) so you need to plant them by late May in northern locations to early July in extremely southern states. Do not plant this tender vegetable until all danger of frost has passed and the soil is warmed as the seedlings will be injured or rot. (See the Almanac.com/Gardening page for frost dates.) That said, pumpkins are easy to maintain if you have the space.",Full Sun,"Pumpkins are very thirsty plants and need lots of water. Water one inch per week. Water deeply, especially during fruit set. When watering: Try to keep foliage and fruit dry unless it’s a sunny day.

They will keep best this way. Do not pick pumpkins off the vine because they have reached your desired size. If you want small pumpkins, buy a small variety. A pumpkin is ripening when its skin turns a deep, solid color (orange for most varieties). When you thumb the pumpkin, the rind will feel hard and it will sound hollow. Press your nail into the pumpkin’s skin; if it resists puncture, it is ripe. To harvest the pumpkin, cut the fruit off the vine carefully with a sharp knife or pruners; do not tear. Be sure not to cut too close to the pumpkin; a liberal amount of stem (3 to 4 inches) will increase the pumpkin’s keeping time.",Pumpkins are HEAVY feeders. Regular treatments of manure or compost mixed with water will sustain good growth.,"Use row covers to protect plants early in the season and to prevent insect problems. However, remember to remove covers before flowering to allow pollination by insects! Add mulch around your pumpkins to keep in moisture, suppress weeks, and discourage pests. Remember that pumpkins are tender from planting to harvest. Control weeds with mulch. Do not over-cultivate, or their very shallow roots may be damaged. Pinch off the fuzzy ends of each vine after a few pumpkins have formed. This will stop vine growth so that the plant’s energies are focused on the fruit.","Powdery Mildew, Anthracnose","Aphids, Squash Borers",,,,,
